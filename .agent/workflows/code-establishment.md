Review the selected code against the 'system-instructions.md' global standards.
1. Security: Replace any hardcoded strings with environment variable placeholders. Ensure RLS is mentioned if SQL is involved.
2. Reliability: Wrap logic in try/catch blocks with proper logging context.
3. Typing: Add strict Type Hints (Python) or TypeScript interfaces.
4. Output: Rewrite the code fully with these improvements.
