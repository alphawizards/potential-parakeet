I am starting a new feature.
Step 1: Analyze my request and generate a Mermaid.js sequence diagram showing the flow between React(Vite) or typescript, Cloudflare, AWS Lambda, and Neon/Supabase.
Step 2: Define the Data Model. Create the Pydantic (Python) or Zod (TypeScript) schemas representing the inputs and outputs.
Step 3: List the necessary files to be created, including the specific AWS CDK/Serverless infrastructure definitions.
DO NOT write the logic code yet. Wait for my approval on the architecture.
